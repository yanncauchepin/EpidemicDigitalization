\chapter*{Thanks}

\textbf{Pedagogical team of Polytech Lille.}\\
I would like to thank the people who taught with great respect, kindness and sympathy. Those interested in education and who have accompanied the students well. Especially teachers in the field of computer science, optimization and English.\\

\textbf{El-Ghazali Talbi.}\\
Many thanks to him for inspiring me to deepen optimization and its applications in reality. With a classmate, he gave us the opportunity to flourish in optimization with an end-of-studies project and then end-of-training internships.\\

\textbf{Emmanuel Kieffer.}\\
Many thanks to him for being a caring tutor. He inspired and supported me to work on this topic. He didn't restrain or constrain my thoughts, left me the autonomy and freedom I need. I was able to balance my mental well-being and be passionate about this project.
